# 🥩 Marinade Staking · Liquid Staking Protocol on Solana  

## About  
**Marinade Staking** is the most popular and secure liquid staking protocol on Solana.  
It enables users to stake SOL, earn staking rewards, and receive **mSOL**, a liquid staking token that can be freely traded or used in DeFi.  

Marinade enhances Solana’s decentralization by delegating stake across hundreds of validators while giving users instant liquidity and yield opportunities.
